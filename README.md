# CE-Gamedle
A Discord guessing game activity based on Challenge Enthusiasts

## Functionality
This game is inspired by [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Gamedle](https://gamedle.wtf). It will provide some information about a game (some that originates from steam or retroachievements, but mostly from Challenge Enthusiasts), like category, tier, number of Objectives, platform, date added to the site, and users will be able to try and guess it.

## Features I want to have
- Lifetime score. I want to be able to have my own leaderboard.
- In tandem with that, [CE Assistant](https://github.com/andykasen13/CE-Assistant-v2) should have some commands to show the leaderboard and any user's specific place.
